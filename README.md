🌱 Ghars – Smart Agriculture Platform

Ghars is a smart agriculture backend platform built using Spring Boot.
The platform helps farmers manage farms, fields, crops, and yields, while providing AI-powered learning, plant identification, disease detection, virtual farming, events, and a full e-commerce system for agricultural products.

🎯 Project Objectives

Digitize farm and crop management

Improve agricultural productivity using AI insights

Support learning-based agriculture for beginners and farmers

Enable virtual farming and simulation

Provide smart plant recommendations

Offer an integrated store with payment and delivery

Support community events and farmer engagement

The project follows a layered architecture:

Controller Layer – RESTful APIs

Service Layer – Business logic and integrations

Repository Layer – Database access using JPA

Model Layer – Entities

DTO Layer – Data transfer objects

External Services – AI, Payment, Email, Automation
